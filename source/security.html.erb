        We take security very seriously and adopt industry best practices to
        minimize the likelihood of introducing vulnerabilities in the Solidus
        codebase. For us, security also means having a clear policy in place
        for reporting and patching vulnerabilities.
      </p>

      <h2>Supported Versions</h2>
      <p>
        Solidus versions will receive security patches for 18 months after
        their initial <a href="/release_policy">release</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following table represents the latest versions with their release date,
        EOL date and current support state.
      </p>

      <%= partial "partials/supported_versions" %>

      <h2>Reporting a vulnerability</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>
          We promise to be always responsive and thankful to those who report
          any security vulnerabilities following the instructions described here.
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        All security bugs in Solidus should be reported through our
        <a href="https://hackerone.com/solidus">
          vulnerability disclosure program page at HackerOne</a>. This will
        deliver a message to a subset of the Core Team who handle
        security issues. Your report will be acknowledged as soon as possible
        and we'll try to get in touch within 5 days.
      </p>

      <p>
        We may ask you to access the Security Advisory created in GitHub to
        help us discover more about the report, fix it, and also to keep you
        informed on progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alternatively, youâ€™ll just receive a detailed response indicating the
        next steps in handling your report. After the first reply to your
        report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress
        being made towards a fix and full announcement. These updates will be
        sent at least every 5 days.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have not received a reply to your report within 5 days, or have
        not heard from the security team for the past 5 days, please, either:

        <ul>
          <li>
            Contact the current security coordinators
            <a href="mailto:security@solidus.io?subject=Solidus Security Issue">
              security@solidus.io
            </a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Contact any other Solidus Core Team member on
            <a href="http://slack.solidus.io/">
              Slack
            </a>
            via direct message.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <div class="font-weight-light">
        <p>
          All response target times are tracked and reported in business days.
          Business days are defined to be:

          <ul>
            <li>Monday - Friday</li>
            <li>24 hours</li>
            <li>Including holidays (hackers never sleep!)</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Disclosure process</h2>

      <h4>
        1. Security Report Received
      </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Report is assigned a primary handler. This person will coordinate
          the fix and release process.
        </li>
        <li>
          Problem is confirmed and a list of all affected versions is determined.
        </li>
        <li>
          Code is audited to find any potential similar problems.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>
        2. Vulnerability Fixed
      </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A new
          <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-maintainer-security-advisories">
            Security Advisory
          </a>
          is created in GitHub to privately discuss and fix the vulnerability
          reported. This will also allow publishing a security alert to Solidus
          users directly on GitHub, only visible to repository users with admin
          permissions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fixes are prepared for all releases which are still supported.
          These fixes are not committed to the public repository but rather
          held privately pending the announcement.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>
        3. Vulnerability Published
      </h4>
      <p>
        <em>
          These actions should be done within the same business day.
        </em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The GitHub Security Advisory is published.
        </li>
        <li>
          A
          <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/solidus-security">
            Solidus Security mailing list
          </a>
          thread is created.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fixed gems versions are released to RubyGems.
        </li>
        <li>
          A blog post is published on solidus.io.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Receiving disclosures</h2>

      <p>
        The best way to receive all the security announcements is to
        <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-security-alerts-for-vulnerable-dependencies">
          enable alerts for vulnerable dependencies in GitHub
        </a>
        or to subscribe to the
        <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/solidus-security">
          Solidus Security mailing list</a>.
        The mailing list is very low traffic, and it receives the public
        notifications the moment the vulnerability is published.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have any suggestions to improve this policy, please send an
        email to the
        <a href="mailto:security@solidus.io?subject=Solidus Security Policy Feedback">
          security policy team</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Additional Security Initiatives</h2>
      <p>
        In addition to the Disclosure Program above we also enforce the
        security of the codebase and released gems through the following
        initiatives:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Two mandatory PR reviews from the Core Team:</b>
          Before merging any PR we need two mandatory reviews from members of
          the Core Team, which helps spot security issues.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Multi-factor authentication enabled on RubyGems:</b>
          All users who have permissions to release a core gem of Solidus
          need to have
          <a href="https://guides.rubygems.org/setting-up-multifactor-authentication/">
            multi-factor authentication enabled on RubyGems
          </a> to avoid gem hijacking.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Automated GitHub Security Fixes:</b>
          When one of the Solidus dependencies receives a security fix, GitHub
          automatically submits a Pull Request on our repository to require the
          library at the patched version.
        </li>
      </ul>
