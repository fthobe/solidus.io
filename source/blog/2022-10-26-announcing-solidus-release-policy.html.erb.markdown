Community is Solidus' most important asset. As you already know, we put a lot
of effort into keeping a high developer experience during upgrades for new
releases. We know it's always difficult for teams to prioritize them, and
programmers often need to carve out time from nowhere. Because of that,
backward compatibility is one of our topmost priorities: we always try our best
not to break anything.

Nonetheless, we reckon we haven't been consistent on the timing for those
releases. That had made some folks wonder when that loved new feature or when
the latest Rails version would be officially integrated. Definitely, that's
something that doesn't help to plan upgrades.

We want to improve there. Because of that, we discussed and agreed on a release
policy that we hope will help the community prepare for Solidus upgrades. As
always in Open Source, resources are limited, but we're confident that this
self-inflicted pressure will help us to keep pace with your expectations.

Please, read the [whole document on our
site](https://solidus.io/release_policy/), but if you're tight on time, here
are the principal takeaways:

- A quarterly new minor release.
- Major releases should not be more than two years apart.
- Patch releases at every backported fix.

Share your ideas. Please, don't think twice about reaching out to us on our
[Slack workspace](http://slack.solidus.io/), and let us know any suggestions or
concerns you might have. We're here to make your experience with the most
customizable e-commerce platform as pleasurable as possible!
